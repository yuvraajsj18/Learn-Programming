*   You can not initialise an array in function parameter like 
    # Set(int arr[] = {0}, int size = 10)
    {0} is not the address but arr[] is a pointer
    either you need to declare another array in visible(like global) scope and then give its address
    # int def[100] = {0};
    # Set(int arr[] = def, int size = 10)
    or set it as NULL
    # Set(int arr[] = NULL, int size = 0)
