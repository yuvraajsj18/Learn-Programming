# The file object has several methods to make it easy to work with the underlying file. 
They include the following:

  - file.read(): This method loads the entire file into memory.

  - file.readline(): This method reads a single line from the file into memory.

  - file.readlines(): This method reads all of the lines of a file into a list.

  - file.write(): This method writes output to the file.

  - file.seek(): This method is used to move the file object position to a certain location in the file.
