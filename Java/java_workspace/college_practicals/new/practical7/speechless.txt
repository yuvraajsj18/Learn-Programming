Here comes a wave meant to wash me away
// A tide that is taking me under
Broken again, left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder
// But I can't cry
And I can't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down
I can't stay silent
// though they wanna keep me quiet
And I tremble when they try it
// All I know is I won't go speechless
