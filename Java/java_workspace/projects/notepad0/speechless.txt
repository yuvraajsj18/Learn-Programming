Here comes a wave meant to wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Broken again, left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder
But I can't cry
This line is edited
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down
I can't stay silent
Though they wanna keep me quiet
And I tremble when they try it
This line also edited
This line is added latter
